# Playback Front End
Playback is a React application that allows transforms user inputs into music, looping through notes from four instruments. This app is for all, regardless of previous music experience.

## Author
Alison McGinley

## Main Features
- User can select one of four instruments
- Each selection loads ten instrument sounds to QWERTYUIOP keys that can be played independently, or together
- "Play" returns the notes that the user has played so far
- While playing, the user can continue to add to the loop

## Current Bugs
- Re-renders components with each new selection and play, resulting in a very slow interface
- Schedule not updating as user adds notes
- Though the functions are written, the app isn't currently listening when the user "clear"s or "stop"s play
- Deployment pending
